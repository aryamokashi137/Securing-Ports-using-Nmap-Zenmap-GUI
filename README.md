# Securing-Ports-using-Nmap-Zenmap-GUI
This project focuses on using **Nmap (via Zenmap GUI)** to perform port scanning, identify open/filtered/closed ports, and secure vulnerable services.   During the analysis, port **3306 (MySQL)** was found to be open and unauthorized. Security measures were implemented to restrict access and harden the system.
